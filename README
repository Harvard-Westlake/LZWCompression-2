My code does not work I have not finished it yet,
 the encode method itself doesn't work and currently gives an error.
 I have gotten an extension from Mr.Theiss and am going to fix it by either
 Monday or Tuesday. 
 If you want more info about how it's broken, there is an issue with index out of
 bounds and problems with encoding the few last characters of the input
